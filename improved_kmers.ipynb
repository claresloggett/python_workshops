      "**Exercise:** If you have not already done so in the introductory workshop, try to solve this problem before you continue. Write a function called `count_kmers` which takes as input a string and an integer k, and returns a dictionary as output. The keys of the dictionary should be all the k-mers that were seen, and the values should be the number of times each k-mer occurs in the string. Make sure to give your function a docstring! You'll be able to use your solution as the basis for the rest of the workshop. \n",

Remember you can use help() to look at the documentation for built-in functions. You may also need to check whether a k-mer is already in the dictionary before you try to increment the count. \n",
